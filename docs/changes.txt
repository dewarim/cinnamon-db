Group.is_user => Group.groupOfOne
User => UserAccount ("user" is a reserved word in several database dialects)
Group => CmnGroup ("group" is a reserved word in SQL, and always having to escape table names gets old very quickly,
    to say nothing about automatically generated code which sometimes cannot do this properly.)
